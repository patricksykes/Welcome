<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Writing can be difficult!</p>
<p><em>“There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.” Ernest Hemingway</em></p>
<p>Writing can be a lot of work!</p>
<p><em>“If I had more time I would have written a shorter letter” Blaize Pascal, 1657</em></p>
<p>Writing can invoke strong feelings!</p>
<p><em>“Here is a lesson in creative writing. The first rule: do not use semicolons. They are transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing. All they do is show you’ve been to college” Kurt Vonnegut, The Man Without a Country</em></p>
<p>Writing can be fun!</p>
<p><em>“To write is human, to edit is divine.” Stephen King</em></p>
<div id="what-is-good-scientific-writing" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.1</span> What is good scientific writing?</h3>
<p>Maybe a truthful but uninformative answer is “You know when you read it!”. Being able to understand the message easily is clearly essential. But so is being concise, as words cost journals money and scientists have limited time to read your work. But good scientific writing is more than just being clear and concise. For example, newspaper articles can be clear and concise, but most would say that the journalistic style is inappropriate in a scientific setting. Scientific writing has a host of conventions, not all of which are always made explicit. For example, adhering to the typical structure of a scientific paper, not using colloquialisms, not providing opinion, and not being emotive, to name a few. Although it might feel that such “rules” take the fun out of writing, good scientific writing should not be bland and boring to read. There is room, and indeed a need, for creativity.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-write-well" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.2</span> Why write well?</h3>
<p>There are many reasons why as scientists we need to write well. First, science is about ideas, and we need to communicate those ideas clearly, effectively and interestingly. An engaged reader will remember what s/he has read. If you fail to communicate effectively, your work will ultimately be of little use to the wider scientific community, resulting in lower uptake and fewer citations.</p>
<p>Second, publishing is the currency of science and requires convincing Editors and Reviewers that your work is robust and meaningful. If your work is not well written, you cannot expect others to understand it. Reviewers can become bogged down in poor writing and sometimes assume that it is indicative of poor science. Reviewers sometimes return poorly written manuscripts directly to the Editor and refuse to review it. At best poor scientific writing leads to delays in the publication process, and at worst outright rejection.</p>
<p>Third, writing clearly will improve your science. If your supervisors, co-authors, and collaborators understand your message and see that you have worked hard to provide a clearly written piece of work, they will provide far better input. If collaborators have to rewrite your work to understand it before they can comment on the content, you will frustrate them immensely and you will receive fewer quality comments about scientific direction and whether your paper hits the mark. In fact, writing well is valued by many collaborators and will lead to more collaborations.</p>
<p>Last, writing well is a fundamental scientific skill (along with, for example, knowledge of the scientific method, quantitative skills, and discipline-specific technical skills), and we have a responsibility to write as well as we can out of respect for others, and to pass this knowledge on. With escalating pressures on academics, fewer of them are taking the time to help students with their writing skills. In the worst cases, supervisors and collaborators to pass on the task of language editing to the peer-review process. This is hugely counterproductive, and simply reinforces the cycle of deterioration in writing skills. Students and the academics who supervise them need to take responsibility in being part of the solution – improving scientific writing by passing on their knowledge to others.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-do-we-have-difficulties-writing-well" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.3</span> Why do we have difficulties writing well?</h3>
<p>We all have to learn scientific writing – scientific English is no one’s first language! And it is even more difficult if English is not your mother tongue, especially for people who speak languages from outside Europe. So scientific writing does not come easily and requires hard work.</p>
<p>Throughout our studies, we are not taught the concepts that are necessary for good writing. In many countries, the teaching of grammar at school is out of vogue. Scientific writing is also often not taught at university at the undergraduate levels. Nowadays, writing well is not a major learning outcome of most science courses, and assignments are marked predominantly on content and not readability and style. It is also easier to learn scientific writing during your postgraduate study when you can draw on your research, but many countries do not have coursework during postgraduate studies. Unfortunately, during this key developmental period, many supervisors often feel too busy to spend time to improve the writing of their students.</p>
<p>Writing well also takes considerable time and effort. Writing well requires hard work rewriting many drafts, being self-critical of your own work, being afraid to make sometimes substantial changes, and opening up yourself to critique and potential criticism from others. For all these reasons, many scientists have trouble writing well. But scientific writing can be learned.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-this-e-book-can-help" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.1.4</span> How this e-book can help</h3>
<p>This e-book, <em>How to write well</em>, provides what we think is best practice in terms of scientific writing and simple approaches to avoid common pitfalls. Often errors in writing are corrected or stylistic suggestions made by supervisors,</p>
<p>reviewers or peers, without an explanation, primarily because of the people are time poor. This book is a result of seeing common mistakes by our students, and wanting to teach them how they can improve their writing. During our careers we have developed inherent knowledge about good scientific writing, and this e- book is an attempt to write this down into a coherent whole that is useful to others.</p>
<p>Our approach is to identify a common problem, explain why it is a problem, illustrate it with examples, and show solutions. The content here is based on our experience, is by no means exhaustive, and others might have a different opinion. We are not English teachers or grammar Nazis (although Dave might be…?). We are merely practicing scientists interested in improving our own and others’ writing by sharing our experiences.</p>
<p>Finally, this is part of a series of e-books that can help guide you through your scientific career. Often the best way to learn much of this information is to seek out a mentor. But it can be difficult to find a mentor with the insight, all-round skills, and the time available to provide advice. We have written this series of e- books to provide you with such a mentor – hopefully to provide the knowledge and guidance that you need in your career.</p>
<p>This is the first e-book in the series. The second e-book is <em>Writing a scientific paper</em>. Early on in our careers we are ill-prepared for this challenge. Experienced scientists generally acquire the skills slowly and haphazardly through osmosis or from trial-and-error. Writing a paper thus often seems like a “dark art” – one that some scientists have mastered, but one that is hidden and rarely shared. The e- book <em>Writing a scientific paper</em> shines a light on the process of writing a scientific paper and helps you master it.</p>
<p>The third e-book is <em>Navigating the peer-review process</em>. This often-overlooked part of the publication process involves understanding what different journals expect, what Editors and Reviewers look for, and how the peer-review process works. The e-book <em>Navigating the peer-review process</em> formalises our knowledge, experiences and opinions over the past 25 years of how we have gotten our work published. This e-book should will boost your chances of getting your work published, make it easier to get it published, reduce the time it takes to get it published, and help you formalise your own best practice.</p>
<p>You can read these e-books in any order, and you can read their chapters in any order, dipping into the chapters most relevant to you. These books are targeted at early- and mid-career researchers, but will also provide insights for more experienced scientists. We would appreciate your feedback about what you found useful (or not) in the e-books, and what you would like to see covered in the future.</p>

<div id="remove-emotive-language" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.1</span> Remove emotive language</h3>
<p>You should try and state the facts without using emotive terms include <em>alarming</em>, <em>concerning</em>, <em>drastic</em>, <em>lovely</em>, <em>useless</em>, <em>wonderful</em> and <em>worringly</em>. Especially in research focusing on conservation of habitats or iconic species, it is easy to use emotive language. If in doubt, think of the animal as a cockroach and see whether you would use the same language!</p>
<p>Rather than: Following those <em>alarming</em> catch reductions, bans for manta ray fisheries were applied to some areas.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> Following declining catches, bans for manta ray fisheries were applied to some areas.</p>
<p><strong>Or, stronger:</strong> Following precipitous declines in catches, bans for manta ray fisheries were applied to some areas.</p>
</div>
<div id="be-consistent" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.2</span> Be consistent</h3>
<p>Reviewers and examiners often regard sloppiness and lack of attention in scientific writing as an indication of carelessness in your science. Some common examples include:
- Use capitals for proper nouns everywhere
- Whether you choose to use <em>–ize</em> or <em>–ise</em>, be consistent
- Whether you choose to use a space (preferably) or not between numbers and their units, be consistent</p>
</div>
<div id="be-particular" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.3</span> Be particular!</h3>
<p>There are a bunch of things that are wrong and are just sloppy. Below are some examples, none of which is that important, but show a lack of care that can make the reader question how careful your science is.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> La Nina/El Nino</p>
<p><strong>It is:</strong> La Niña/El Niño</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> <em>Homo spp.</em></p>
<p><strong>It is:</strong> <em>Homo</em> spp. (Only the genus names is italicised).</p>
<p>**** Rather than: m2</p>
<p><strong>It is:</strong> m2</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> <a href="http://www.lternet.edu/">www.lternet.edu</a></p>
<p><strong>It is:</strong> <span class="underline">www.lternet.edu (</span>Enables the Reader to use the hyperlink in a pdf).</p>
</div>
<div id="repetition-is-good" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.4</span> Repetition is good!</h3>
<p>Scientific writing is different from writing novels. For example, in a novel an author might use different terms to identify the same thing to make it more interesting. However, in a scientific paper, repetition of the same term in makes it easier for the Reader to follow.</p>
</div>
<div id="elegant-variation-confuses" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.5</span> Elegant variation confuses…</h3>
<p>When there are multiple ways to say the same thing, one should not cycle through the different options for “elegant variation” because the use of a different word to a Reader can suggest something different is happening. For example, if a scientist is working on ‘copepods’, it is best to use this consistently throughout the paper, rather than referring to them variedly as ‘small crustaceans’, ‘zooplankton’, ‘maxillopodes’, ‘arthropods’, and ‘insects of the sea’, as the Reader will wonder if the author means different things by the different terms.</p>
<p>In the following example, the Author has switched from using ‘measurement types’ and ‘ecological traits’ to ‘measurement attributes’ and ‘ecological characters’, making the Reader wonder if it is the same quantities being described.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> Predictors were divided into two categories: measurement types and ecological traits. For measurement attributes we considered the frequency of sampling. For ecological characters we used a global database.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> Predictors were divided into two categories: measurement types and ecological traits. For measurement types we considered the frequency of sampling. For ecological traits we used a global database.</p>
<p>The following example uses ‘influenced’ and ‘described’ in similar contexts, leaving the Reader wondering whether the author meant to highlight such a difference.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> While the abundance of pelagic fish is <em>influenced</em> by food availability and reproduction, their movement is <em>described</em> by oceanographic variables.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> While the abundance of pelagic fish is <em>influenced</em> by food availability and reproduction, their movement is <em>influenced</em> by oceanographic variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="making-word-structure-parallel" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.6</span> Making word structure parallel…</h3>
<p>Repetition of structure in sentences and paragraphs, and even in headings, can make things easier to follow because it meets the expectations of a Reader. In the following example, the US is at the end of its part of the sentence and the UK is at the start.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> …targeting the National Science Foundation in the US and the UK Natural Environment Research Council.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> …targeting the US National Science Foundation and the UK Natural Environment Research Council.</p>
<p>The specification of these three regions is not consistence amongst the parts of the sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> The northern region (10-25˚S) is characterised by warm tropical surface waters and a shallow mixed layer, subtropical waters form the central region (25-45˚S), and the most southern region (45-60˚S) verges on cooler subantarctic waters.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> The northern region (10-24˚S) has warm tropical surface waters and a shallow mixed layer, the central region (24-45˚S) has subtropical and well mixed waters, and the southern region (45-50˚S) has cool subantarctic waters.</p>
</div>
<div id="be-specific" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.7</span> Be specific</h3>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> Aggregations of reef manta rays <em>Manta alfredi</em>, such as those in the Maldives, Western Australia, and Komodo National Park in Indonesia are correlated with productivity.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> Reef manta rays <em>Manta alfredi</em> in the Maldives, Western Australia, and in Indonesia aggregate in regions and at times when there is greater productivity.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> The third version of the Receiving Water Quality Model, which is the version used in this study, resolved several limitations of the second version. <strong>Try:</strong> We used the third version of the Receiving Water Quality Model, which resolved several limitations of the second version, including X, Y and Z.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> As a consequence, many diatoms exhibit a discontinuous seasonal occurrence that usually coincides with the introduction of nutrients such as during spring blooms.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> Consequently, many diatoms peak during spring when nutrients and light are available.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> etc.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> Remove etc. from lists or precede it with “such as” or “including”,</p>
<p><strong>Why?:</strong> “etc.” is vague and everyone will think of different things. Using “such as” or “including” makes it clear you are only listing some of the options.</p>
</div>
<div id="be-formal-not-colloquial" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.8</span> Be formal, not colloquial</h3>
<p>Scientific writing is a formal writing style and using colloquialisms are not appropriate. For example, using a phrase we might commonly use in everyday conversation such as “something is cool” is not appropriate (unless referring to temperature!). It might be more appropriate, however, in a scientific talk, to show you were excited about your results.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> Like</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> Such as</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> My results were not very good/puzzling.</p>

<div id="typeset-equations-properly" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.9</span> Typeset equations properly</h3>
<p>If using Word, equations should be included using the Equation Editor, as numbers and variables are treated differently (e.g., variables are italicised) and the typesetting is clearer (e.g., for quotients). It is also better to have units in text rather than equation</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> <em>MR (calories kg<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>) = (68.9+177.8 * W) * 3.25 / (W * 24)</em></p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> The equation for Metabolic Rate (𝑀𝑅, calories kg-1 d-1) as a function of Mass (𝑊, kg) is: <em>MR</em> = 3.5 × 68.9 + 177.8<em>W</em> / 24×𝑊</p>

<div id="importantcrucialcritical" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.5.2</span> Important/crucial/critical</h3>
<p>The words “important”, “crucial” and “critical” are overused. If we say everything is important, crucial or critical, then they lose their impact and meaning. These words can be powerful when used sparingly and if the reasoning behind them is explained. If they are used multiple times in a paper, these words can often be removed with no ill effect. Valuable can often be used instead, but should also be followed by an explanation.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.5.3</span> Respectively</h3>

<div id="confusing-word-pairs" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.6</span> Confusing word pairs</h2>
<p>Here are some confusing word pairs and how to select the correct word.</p>
<p><em><strong>‘A’</strong></em> vs <em><strong>‘an’</strong></em></p>
<p>We know that ‘a’ is used before a word starting with a consonant, and ‘an’ is used before a word starting with a vowel. But, which sounds better?</p>
<p>“An university degree” or “A university degree”?</p>
<p>Here even though ‘university’ starts with a vowel, the ‘u’ makes the sound of the consonant ‘y’ (as in ‘yellow’) and thus sounds better with an ‘a’. So the rule that ‘an’ should precede words that start with a vowel is a generalization that does not cover all situations. An addendum to this rule is that ‘a’ should precede words where the first letter makes the sound of a consonant. Similarly, ‘an’ should precede words where the first letter makes the sound of a vowel.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that some writers use “a hypothesis” and others use “an hypothesis”. We prefer using “a hypotheisis”.</p>

<div id="aims-vs-objectives" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.3</span> ‘Aims’ vs ‘objectives’</h3>
<p>Although some authors use these interchangeably, careful writers distinguish them. Aims (and similarly goals) are general statements and are usually long- term or big picture. Objectives are specific, concrete statements that are often short-term, and can follow the SMART framework (Specific, Measurable, Accurate, Reasonable and Time-bound).

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.4</span> ‘All together’ vs ‘Altogether’</h3>
<p>‘Altogether’ means ‘overall’ or ‘completely’. ‘All together’ pertains to a group and means ‘everyone’ or everything-together’.</p>
<p>One way of assessing which to use is to test the sentence without the word ‘all’. If the sentence remains intact and comprehensible without ‘all’, it means the appropriate adverb is ‘all together’. If it no longer makes sense after ‘all’ has been removed, ‘altogether’ should be used.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.9</span> ‘Dependent’ vs ‘Dependant’</h3>
<p>In UK English, ‘Dependant’ is the noun, and ‘dependent’ is the adjective. In scientific writing, almost all cases are ‘dependent’. This distinction is not made in US English; it uses ‘dependent’ in both instances.</p>

<div id="effect-vs-affect" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.10</span> ‘Effect’ vs ‘Affect’</h3>
<p>‘Effect’ and ‘affect’ are probably the two words that are regularly confused in scientific writing. ‘Affect’ is a verb meaning ‘to influence’. ‘Effect’ is usually a noun meaning result, but it can also (more rarely) be used as a verb meaning to cause. ‘Effect’ as a noun is followed by the preposition ‘on’ and preceded by an article (‘a’, ‘an’, ‘the’).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Temperature affects metabolic rates. (Affect is a verb).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Temperature has an effect on metabolism. (Common use of effect as a noun).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Temperature effects a change on metabolism. (Rarer use of effect as a verb).</p>
</div>
<div id="either-or-vs-neither-nor" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.11</span> ‘Either or’ vs ‘Neither nor’</h3>
<p>These apply to no more than two items. Similarly, former and latter refer only to the first and second of only two items.</p>
</div>
<div id="estimated-vs-measured-vs-quantified-vs-determined-vs-assessed" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.12</span> ‘Estimated’ vs ‘Measured’ vs ‘Quantified’ vs ‘Determined’ vs ‘Assessed’</h3>
<p>These verbs all have somewhat similar meanings, but there are nuanced differences. They are generally not used interchangeably. It is worthwhile giving some thought to which is appropriate in different circumstances, but one should not cycle through the different options for “elegant variation” because the use of a different word to a Reader can suggest something different is happening. Although it is difficult to give hard-and-fast rules, and it can be slightly different depending on discipline, but here are some rules-of-thumb.</p>
</div>
<div id="measured" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.13</span> Measured</h3>
<p>Measured is used when a relatively simple instrument is used to make a measurement. Although in the following examples it is correct grammatically to use estimated, quantified, assessed, quantified or determined instead of measured, measured is more appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> We measured the temperature of seawater using a thermometer.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> We used an anemometer to measure wind strength and direction.</p>
</div>
<div id="estimated" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.14</span> Estimated</h3>
<p>Estimated is less precise than measured. We often measure physical quantities and estimate biological quantities.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> We estimated the density of fish using visual transects.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> You estimate the density of copepods in the surface water</p>
</div>
<div id="assessed" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.15</span> Assessed</h3>
<p>Assessed is generally used when testing a hypothesis, answering a question, or drawing conclusions from data.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> We assessed whether the density of fish was related to habitat quality.</p>
</div>
<div id="quantified" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.16</span> Quantified</h3>
<p>Quantified is typically used when you want to find a count, amount or a percentage of something.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> We quantified the number of fish on the reef.</p>
</div>
<div id="determined" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.17</span> Determined</h3>
<p>Can be used when experimental values recorded by an instrument have to be processed to obtain the values.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> We determined the chlorophyll concentations by measuring the fluorescence.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> We determined that copepods stop feeding at food concentrations &lt;0.01 mg.m3 of chl-a.</p>
</div>
<div id="led-vs-lead" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.18</span> ‘Led’ vs ‘Lead’</h3>
<p>Mixing these two is a very common mistake in scientific writing.</p>
<p><em>Led</em> is the past tense and past participle of the verb <em>to lead</em> (rhymes with <em>bead</em>). Lead (rhymes with <em>bead</em>) is a noun referring to an initiative or a position at the front.</p>
<p>Lead (rhymes with <em>red</em>) is also a noun referring to the metal.</p>
<p><em>&quot;</em>The Australian programme is led by the University of Queensland, which is also the lead institution in the International Consortium of Lead Research Institutions.&quot;</p>

<div id="lesser-vs-fewer" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.19</span> ‘Lesser’ vs ‘Fewer’</h3>
<p>‘Lesser’ refers to quantity, whereas ’fewer refers to number.</p>
</div>
<div id="maybe-vs-may-be" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.20</span> ‘Maybe’ vs ‘May be’</h3>
<p>“Maybe” is an adverb and refers to a choice. “Maybe” means “perhaps” when used as an adverb and denotes a choice. A simple trick of finding out if you have used “maybe” in the right place is by interchanging “maybe” with “perhaps.” The sentence should refer to a choice and make sense.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> The jellyfish collected by the Continuous Plankton Recorder are primarily epipelagic, but <em>may be</em> not neustonic.</p>
<p><strong>It is:</strong> The jellyfish collected by the Continuous Plankton Recorder are primarily epipelagic, but <em>maybe</em> not neustonic.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> A decline of mud content in sediments took place over extensive areas, <em>may be</em> because of the removal of all mussel beds around 1990.</p>
<p><strong>It is:</strong> A decline of mud content in sediments took place over extensive areas, <em>maybe</em> because of the removal of all mussel beds around 1990.</p>
<p>“May be” is a verb and refers to a possibility. The way to check if “may be” is correct, is to substitute “could be” or “would be” in its place. If it makes sense, the usage is correct.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> It maybe difficult to separate from’ ‘Coelenterate tissue’’ if the bell is not found.</p>
<p><strong>It is:</strong> It may be difficult to separate from’ ‘Coelenterate tissue’’ if the bell is not found.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> Generally, all individuals are counted, but for particularly dense samples a sub-sample maybe counted.</p>
<p><strong>It is:</strong> Generally, all individuals are counted, but for particularly dense samples a sub-sample may be counted.</p>
</div>
<div id="may-vs-might-vs-could" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.21</span> ‘May’ vs ‘Might’ vs ‘Could’</h3>
<p>Some journals prefer ‘might’ rather than ‘may’ because ‘may’ can have a connotation of permission. ‘Could’ is often stronger than ‘may’ or ‘might’ and thus is preferable sometimes.</p>
</div>
<div id="past-vs-last" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.22</span> ‘Past’ vs ‘Last’</h3>
<p>There is not much difference, but careful writers prefer ‘past’. This is because ‘last’ can have the connotation of finality; there can be nothing after the last. It is thus preferable to use ‘past’ when referring to the period of time leading up to the present.</p>
</div>
<div id="practice-vs-practise" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.23</span> ‘Practice’ vs ‘Practise’</h3>
<p>‘Practice’ is a noun referring to the application of an idea (‘the practice of science’), the exercise of a profession (‘he left scientific practice’), customary procedure (‘it was common practice’), or repeated exercise or performance (‘knowing his times table required a lot of practice’)</p>
<p>‘Practise’ is a verb meaning to perform an activity or skill repeatedly to improve one's proficiency (‘He practised his dissection techniques’, or to observe or work at something (‘She practises science’)</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> You can practise your grammar at English Practice.</p>
<p>Note that in US English, ‘practise’ is not used at all, only ‘practice’ for both meanings. If unsure, do what the Americans do and use practice!</p>
</div>
<div id="predominate-vs-predominant" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.24</span> Predominate vs Predominant</h3>
<p>Predominate is a verb. Predominant is the adjective; as an adverb, predominantly (not &quot;predominately&quot;).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Brown eye colour is the predominant trait</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Brown eye colour predominates in humans.</p>
</div>
<div id="principle-vs-principal" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.25</span> ‘Principle’ vs ‘Principal’</h3>
<p>‘Principle’ is always a noun and is a ‘basic truth’ or ‘rule’</p>
<p>‘Principal’ can be an adjective or a noun. As an adjective it means ‘most important’. As a noun it means an “administrator” or &quot;sum of money’. Note that when principal is used as a noun (e.g. <em>principal</em> of a school or the <em>principal</em> of a loan), it is the shortened form of a phrase (‘<em>principal teacher</em>’ or ‘<em>principal</em> sum’).</p>
<p><em>Hint:</em> A useful way to remember which one to use is: &quot;If you can substitute ‘main’ (which contains an ‘a’), use <em>principal</em> (which also contains an ‘a’). If you can substitute ‘rule’ (which ends in ‘le’), use <em>principle</em> (which also ends in ‘le’) (William and Mary Morris, <em>Harper Dictionary of Contemporary Usage</em>. Harper &amp; Row, 1975).</p>

<div id="should-vs-could" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.26</span> Should vs Could</h3>
<p>Stating something “should” be done, rather than “could” be done, can be interpreted as too prescriptive and even a bit arrogant. It is usually better to say “could”.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> Further studies should investigate vertical water column biomass structure as concentrated zooplankton prey densities may occur deeper at this site.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> Further studies could investigate vertical water column biomass structure as concentrated zooplankton prey densities may occur deeper at this site</p>
</div>
<div id="toward-vs-towards" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.27</span> ‘Toward’ vs ‘Towards’</h3>
<p>These are interchangeable. US and Canadian writers ‘towards’ and British and other English writers prefer ‘towards’. The same is true for ‘backwards/fowards’ and ‘backward/forward’ when used as adverb in the UK and US respectively. But when used as an adverb ‘Something is backward compatible’ or ‘She is forward- looking’, then it never has an ‘s’.</p>
</div>
<div id="where-vs-when" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.28</span> ‘Where’ vs ‘When’</h3>
<p>Think about whether the sentence is talking about space or time. For example:</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> “Where <em>M. birostris</em> were observed with their cephalic fins firmly rolled up and not engaging in any other activity, behaviour was designated as cruising.”</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> “When <em>M. birostris</em> were observed with their cephalic fins firmly rolled up and not engaging in any other activity, behaviour was designated as cruising.”</p>
</div>
<div id="which-vs-that" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.6.29</span> ‘Which’ vs ‘That’</h3>
<p>Distinguishing these two words can help to make intended relationships unmistakable, which is important in reporting scientific information. If the clause can be omitted without leaving the modified noun incomplete, use which and enclose the clause within commas or parentheses; otherwise, use that.</p>
<p>Careful users of English distinguish the two. A ‘that’ should be used before a restrictive clause and ‘which’ before a non-restrictive clause. A restrictive clause is one that defines the situation and cannot be removed. A non-restrictive clause is separated by commas and is an additional piece of information that can be removed from the sentence without altering the meaning.</p>
<p>For example, which of the following is correct:</p>
<p>“Chickens that are well fed produce many eggs”
“Chickens, which are well fed, produce many eggs”
“Chickens which are well fed produce many eggs”</p>
<p>The 1st one is correct, because only chickens that are well fed will produce many eggs. In the 2nd sentence, removing the ‘which are well fed’ separated by commas, leaves us with a sentence ‘Chickens produce many eggs’ that has a different meaning to the first sentence and is untrue (chickens produce no eggs when they are starving). In the 3rd sentence, it is better to replace the ‘which’ with ‘that’, as a clause with ‘which’ should be separated by commas and it is not then the restrictive clause that is needed here. Here is another example:</p>
<p>“Copepods that are the world’s most abundant metazoans are ubiquitous.” “Copepods, which are the world’s most abundant metazoans, are ubiquitous.” “Copepods which are the world’s most abundant metazoans are ubiquitous.” Here the 2nd one is correct. The ‘which are the world’s most abundant metazoans’ is a non-restrictive clause, and removing this clause does not change the meaning of the sentence ‘Copepods are ubiquitous’.</p>
<p>Although this might seem to be splitting hairs (or setae in the case of copepods!), it helps the Reader more easily follow your writing.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.7</span> Punctuation</h2>
<div id="apostrophes" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.7.1</span> Apostrophes</h3>
<p>Apostrophes are used to show the omission of a letter or letters in a contraction, and to indicate possession. The possessive case causes the most problems. The following guidelines apply:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Singular nouns are made possessive by adding an apostrophe and an ‘s’ at the end of them, even if they end in an ‘s’ or ‘ss’:</li>
</ol>
<p>The manta’s feeding area (the feeding area belongs to the manta) The student’s thesis (the thesis belongs to the student)</p>
<p>The pus’s colour (the colour belongs to the pus)</p>
<p>The moss’s growth (the growth belongs to the moss)</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Plural nouns (e.g. multiple animals) that end in ‘s’ (which is most plurals) are made possessive by adding an apostrophe without an ‘s’:</li>
</ol>
<p>The mantas’ feeding area (the feeding area belongs to multiple mantas).</p>
<p>The fishes’ tank (the tank belongs to the fish)</p>
<p>The students' theses (the theses belong to the students)</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Plural nouns that do not end in ‘s’ are made possessive by adding an apostrophe with an ‘s’:</li>
</ol>
<p>The people’s conference (the conference belonging to the people) The
sheep’s brains (the brains belonging to the sheep)</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>There is an exception to #1. If the singular and plural of a noun both end in an ‘s’, the possessive for both is then formed by adding an apostrophe only:</li>
</ol>
<p>The species’ status is endangered (the status belonging to species)</p>
<p>Rabies’ cases were increasing (the cases belonging to rabies)</p>
<p>In the case of a noun where both forms end in an ‘s’, it may be necessary to reword the sentence to clarify whether you are referring to a singular or plural noun:</p>
<p>The status of the species was endangered. The status of the two species was endangered.</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>When two or more nouns possess the same thing, add apostrophe ‘s’ to
the last noun:</li>
</ol>
<p>Smith and Pauly’s paper (Smith and Pauly worked together on the same paper)</p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>When two or more nouns separately possess something, add apostrophe ‘s’ to each noun:</li>
</ol>
<p>Smith's and Pauly’s papers (Each person has their own paper)</p>
<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Do Not Use an Apostrophe with Possessive Pronouns. Possessive pronouns already show ownership (e.g. yours, his, hers, theirs). However, we do add an apostrophe ‘s’ to form the possessive of some indefinite pronouns (e.g. anybody's guess, one's personal responsibility, somebody's breakthrough)</p></li>
<li><p>Do not use an apostrophe when the word desired is a plura. For example, it shodul be 1980s, not 1980’s.</p></li>

<p><strong>Try:</strong> It is difficult to calculate its value</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="commas" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.7.3</span> Commas</h3>
<p>Commas make your writing more readable and sometimes are essential for correct meaning. A comma is used to break up two clauses where a pause is needed between them. The pause can be used to introduce a new idea or to separate items in a list. A comma often helps to separate clauses that being with “but” or “with”, and at pauses at start of sentences, say after “Similarly,”.</p>
<p>The following sentence is more readable with a comma after “reproduction”.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> While the abundance of pelagic fish is influenced by food availability and reproduction their movement is influenced by oceanographic variables.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> While the abundance of pelagic fish is influenced by food availability and reproduction, their movement is influenced by oceanographic variables.</p>
<p>Similarly, a comma after “live weight” makes the following sentence clearer.</p>
<p>Without the comma after “live weight”, you have to read the first sentence multiple times to understand its meaning.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> As data were expressed in terms of live weight conversion factors were used again to determine the weight of consumable seafood in tonnes.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> As data were expressed in terms of live weight, conversion factors were used to determine the weight of consumable seafood in tonnes.</p>
<p>Often a comma is needed for clarity in a list when there are multiple “ands”. In the following, the comma after “flows” makes the list much easier to read.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> The tidal range, flood and ebb flows and reef morphology create patterns in zooplankton accumulation and productivity around islands.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> The tidal range, flood and ebb flows, and reef morphology create patterns in zooplankton accumulation and productivity around islands.</p>
<p>Sometimes the meaning of a sentence can be changed entirely depending on if and where a comma is used.</p>
<p><strong>Version 1:</strong> While this hypothesis has not been formally tested, at least for Irukandji it appears to be fairly reliable. (The hypothesis has not been tested but appears to be reliable for Irukandji)</p>
<p><strong>Version 2:</strong> While this hypothesis has not been formally tested, at least for the Irukandji <em>Carukia barnesi</em>, it does appear to be fairly reliable. (The hypothesis has not been tested for Irukandji, but it appears reliable for other species)</p>
<p>And one last example to illustrate that you can get yourself into real trouble with the (mis)-use of commas. This appeared in the Times, intended as a description of a Peter Ustinov documentary:</p>
<p><strong>Hmmm:</strong> Highlights of his global tour include encounters with Nelson Mandela, an 800-year-old demigod and a dildo collector.</p>
<p>Do not omit commas before conjunctions in compound sentences.</p>
</div>
<div id="spaces" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.7.4</span> Spaces</h3>
<p>Historically writers have used two spaces after a fullstop, but now the norm is to use one space. This is the standard in scientific journals. It also makes your work a bit shorter, which is always good. You can search for two spaces and replace with one space once ready to submit.</p>
<p>Most journals use a space between numbers and units. Usually journals do not leave a space between the number and units of °C, %, °N, °S, °E, °W.</p>
</div>
<div id="hyphens" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.7.5</span> Hyphens</h3>
<p>Hyphening of compound or unit modifiers is often needed to clarify what is modifying what. For example, a small-grain harvest (harvest of small grain) is different from a small grain harvest (small harvest of all grain). A man eating fish is different from a man-eating fish! (see <a href="http://www.chem.ucla.edu/dept/Faculty/merchant/pdf/Word_Usage_Scientific_Writin"><span class="underline">http://www.chem.ucla.edu/dept/Faculty/merchant/pdf/Word_Usage_Scientific_Writin</span></a> <span class="underline">g.pdf</span>)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="short-and-simple-sentences" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.8</span> Short and simple sentences</h2>
<p>There is a tendency in scientific writing to have long, complex sentences, making it difficult for the Reader to follow. Your work will be cited more if you use shorter and more understandable sentences. If you need to have a long sentence, follow it with a short sentence to give the Reader a rest.</p>
<p>One way of assessing how convoluted your writing is, is to use a Fog Index. Gunnings’s Fog Index is the best known and measures the level of reading difficulty of any document. It is an estimate of the education grade/year that a Reader would need to understand your work. It can be calculated at <a href="http://gunning-fog-index.com/index.html"><span class="underline">http://gunning-fog-index.com/index.html</span>.</a></p>
<p>Gunning’s Fog Index = <span class="math display">\[(average number of words per sentence) + (number of words of 3 syllables or more)\]</span> × 0.4</p>
<p>The Bible, Shakespeare and Mark Twain all have Fog Indexes of about 6. Time, Newsweek, and the Wall Street Journal average about 11. Scientific writing has higher Fog Indexes because of the nature of the content, but it is worth calculating yours for different pieces of work and try to reduce it. If your Fog Index soars then you might lose your readers in the fog!</p>
<p>Microsoft Word calculates two other indexes for you. The Flesch Reading Ease Test is on a 100-point scale, with the higher the score the easier it is to read. The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Test rates text on a U.S. school grade level, similar to the Gunnings Fog Index, with a score of 7 meaning that a seventh grader can understand it. You can calculate these directly in your Word documents. In Windows, under Word ‘Options’, click ‘Proofing’, select ‘Check grammar with spelling’, and under ‘When correcting grammar in Word’ select ‘Show readability statistics check box’. For a Mac, go to Word ‘Preferences’, select ‘Spelling and Grammar’, and check ‘Show readability statistics’. When you then go through and use Tools Spelling and Grammar, Word will give you scores for the Flesch Reading Ease Test and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Test.</p>
<div id="can-you-say-something-more-simply-make-explicit-statements" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.8.1</span> Can you say something more simply? Make explicit statements</h3>
<p>Many scientists are reluctant to state facts explicitly, constantly couching expressions in vague terms. Maybe the logic is that if you are not making definitive statements then you can never be wrong. However, this means you end up saying very little, and what you do say confuses rather than informs. Remember words cost money for a journal (in terms of space) so be concise. A key skill in science is to be clear what we know and state those explicitly, and what we suspect/think and couch those more carefully. Many times, explicit statements are much clearer.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.8.3</span> Removing redundancy in sentences</h3>
<p>Sentences can often be made clearer and shorter by removing redundant and superfluous words. In the following sentence, the last clause “but this remains undemonstrated” is redundant, as it is implied by the third clause “has been hypothesized to cause illness”.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> One species in the genus Carybdea, the Australian form of <em>Carybdea xaymacana</em>, has been hypothesised to cause illness, but this remains undemonstrated.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> One species in the genus Carybdea, the Australian form of <em>Carybdea xaymacana</em>, has been hypothesised to cause illness.</p>
<p>In the following example, there is no need to give coordinates when you refer to a map in a figure.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> The region was subsetted into five discrete 5° latitudinal by 5° longitudinal cells for analyses (Figure 1). The five regions included the north- south latitudinal gradient with the following coordinates; region 1, 20°S to 25°S, 20°S, 155°E to 160°E; region 2, 25°S to 30°S, 155°E to 160°E; region 3, 30°S to 35°S, 155°E to 160°E; region 4, 35°S to 40°S, 152.5°E to 157.5°E; and region 5, 40°S to 45°S, 150°E to 155°E.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> The region was subsetted into five 5° latitudinal by 5° longitudinal cells for analyses (Figure 1).</p>
<p>In the next example, it is best not to refer back to previous sections of your work (e.g., as described/discussed/mentioned above, as described/discussed/mentioned previously), because it is vague, as you know exactly where, but your Readers do not. You should either assume people have read it or be more explicit about what you are referring to. The same goes for referring to something below.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.9</span> Effective sentences</h2>
<p>Sentences are the building blocks of any written piece. Knowing how to write well means getting your sentences right.</p>
<div id="agreement-of-subject-and-verb" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.9.1</span> Agreement of subject and verb</h3>
<p>Singular subjects need singular verbs and plural subjects need plural verbs. This can be tricky when the subject is not immediately next to the verb, as in the following. In the following two examples, the subject of the sentence is singular (‘information’ and ‘number’) and not plural (‘parameters’ or ‘analyses’), so a singular verb (‘is’) is needed.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> <em>Information</em> on basic biological parameters <em>are</em> essential.</p>
<p><strong>It is:</strong> <em>Information</em> on basic biological parameters <em>is</em> essential.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> A <em>number</em> of supplementary analyses <em>were</em> conducted.</p>
<p><strong>It is:</strong> A <em>number</em> of supplementary analyses <em>was</em> conducted</p>
<p>Here is one final example of a singular subject (‘distance’) needing a singular verb (‘is’).</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> The <em>distance</em> shifted at the leading and trailing edges <em>are</em> less prominent.</p>
<p><strong>It is:</strong> The <em>distance</em> shifted at the leading and trailing edges <em>is</em> less prominent</p>
<p>And here is an example where the subject of the sentence is plural (‘distances’) and not singular (‘edge’), so a plural verb (‘are’) is needed.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> <em>Distances</em> shifted at the leading and trailing edge <em>is</em> less prominent.</p>
<p><strong>It is:</strong> <em>Distances</em> shifted at the leading and trailing edge <em>are</em> less prominent.</p>
</div>
<div id="putting-like-things-together" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.9.2</span> Putting like things together</h3>
<p>Similar points should be closer together in a sentence or you risk. Here mercury and lead are not tissues but trace elements, so should go near trace elements.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> Elasmobranchs accumulate trace elements in their tissues such as mercury and lead.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> Elasmobranchs accumulate trace elements such as mercury and lead in their tissues</p>
</div>
<div id="active-vs-passive-voice" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.9.3</span> Active vs Passive voice</h3>
<p>There are two voices in English – active and passive. The active voice is often more direct, clearer and vivid, and is preferred for scientific writing and giving instructions. However, the passive voice is preferred when the subject of the sentence is implied, indefinite, general, unimportant, or if the writer is trying to increase vagueness or suspense. The passive voice often uses the word ‘by’ and is usually longer. The active voice often used personal pronouns (I, We, His, Her, Us). Historically, it has been frowned upon to use personal pronouns in scientific writing, perhaps because science should be independent of personal biases and detached from the researchers themselves. We are often taught in our undergraduate studies that using personal pronouns in scientific writing is anathema and many traditional scientists still reject it.</p>
<p>In more recent years, however, there has been a push toward using the active rather than the passive voice in scientific writing because it is more direct and shorter. Our advice is to write in the active voice and use personal pronouns wherever you need to. Occasionally you will get an Editor who might not like it, but this is increasingly rare. If you do strike an Editor who does not like it, change it. Microsoft Word will highlight passive sentences and help you change them.</p>
<p>Examples of passive vs active voice follow. Which voice do you prefer?</p>
<p>##Passive:## Gravity was discovered by Galileo. <em>Here ‘Gravity’ is the subject, ‘Galileo’ is the object and ‘was discovered by’ is the verb.</em></p>
<p>##Active:## Galileo discovered gravity. <em>Here ‘Galileo’ is the subject of the sentence, ‘gravity’ is the object and ‘discovered’ is the verb</em></p>
<p>##Passive 1:## An ecosystem model was constructed by us. <em>Here ‘an ecosystem model’ is the subject, ‘us’ is the object, and ‘was constructed by’ is the verb.</em></p>
<p>##Passive 2:## An ecosystem model was constructed. <em>As above, but the object “us” is implied.</em></p>
<p>##Active:## We constructed an ecosystem model. <em>Here ‘We’ is the subject, ‘an ecosystem model’ is the object, and ‘constructed’ is the verb.</em></p>
<p>##Rather than##: Photosynthesis is regulated by light and nutrients.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> Light and nutrients regulate photosynthesis.</p>
</div>
<div id="logical-sequence" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.9.4</span> Logical sequence</h3>
<p>It is usually best to use a logical sequence in a sentence, wherever possible. For example, in time (e.g., February before March), space (e.g., describe sites from North to South), phylogenetically (e.g., from simple to complex), or importance (e.g., human stresses on ecosystems that are most to least harmful). When this is not possible, alphabetical order is a good option.</p>
<p>In the next example, transposing ‘weekly and daily’ makes more sense, as the sentence now goes from hourly, through daily, to weekly.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> Hourly data were used for the case studies, while weekly and daily means were calculated for time-series analyses.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> Hourly data were used for the case studies, while daily and weekly means were calculated for time-series analyses.</p>
</div>
<div id="numbers-in-sentences" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.9.5</span> Numbers in sentences</h3>
<p>The general rule of writing numbers is that you spell out numbers less than 10 and write as a number those 10 or greater. There are a few extensions to this though.</p>
<p>Never write numbers before units.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> five m.s-1</p>
<p><strong>It is:</strong> 5 m.s-1</p>
<p>When there are several numbers in a sentence and some are smaller and some are larger than 10, it is clearer for Readers to write them all as numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> The three lionesses had 10 cubs.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> The 3 lionesses had 10 cubs.</p>
<p>Some writers do not like starting a sentence with a number and prefer to spell it out, but it is usually neater to rewrite the sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> 50 samples were collected.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> A total of 50 samples were collected.</p>
</div>
<div id="one-idea-per-sentence" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.9.6</span> One idea per sentence</h3>
<p>One idea per sentence makes it easier to follow, although two ideas can be linked if they are short and simple.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> Occurring in all of the world’s oceans, diatoms are primarily comprised of rigid silica walls and are the first taxa to rapidly increase their abundance, or “bloom” following the introduction of nutrient-rich waters.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> Diatoms have rigid silica walls and are found in all oceans. Diatoms are the first taxa to rapidly increase in abundance (“bloom”) following the introduction of nutrient-rich waters.</p>
</div>
<div id="lists-in-a-sentence" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.9.7</span> Lists in a sentence</h3>
<p>A standard way to have a list in a sentence is to start it with a colon, have semicolons between the items, and to use an ‘and’ after the last semicolon. It can be with or without numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Assuming these trends in ocean warming are continued in the future, we hypothesise that: (1) pelagic fish species leading edges would shift further than their trailing edges; (2) shifts would be greater in winter than summer; and (3) shallower species would shift further south than deeper species.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.10</span> Effective paragraphs</h2>
<div id="structure" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.10.1</span> Structure</h3>
<p>Topic sentence and concluding sentences in paragraphs – not appropriate in fictional writing.</p>
<p>The 1st sentence of a paragraph should summarize the paragraph. Thus if you want to skim a paper, you should be able to read the 1st sentence of each paragraph and follow the logic of the paper. This means that when writing a paragraph, keep in mind that it should give the overall message of the paragraph.</p>
<p>Paragraphs should also not be too long. The longer the paragraph, the more difficult it is for the Reader to follow the message, and the more likely the Writer is to meander. Short, punchy paragraphs will best convey your messages.</p>
<p>Here it is useful to separate the single long paragraph into two shorter paragraphs so the Reader does not get the impression that you are saying the same thing twice – it emphasises that one analysis is for Biomass and the other one is for Abundance.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than:</strong> Zooplankton biomass was significantly higher during manta ray feeding events than when manta rays were not feeding or were absent (ANOVA F<sub>(2,87)</sub>=11.41, p=3.98x10-5; Figure 4a). There was no significant difference in zooplankton biomass when manta rays were not feeding or were absent. Zooplankton was also significantly more abundant during feeding events than when manta rays were not feeding or were absent (ANOVA F<sub>2,47</sub>=11.48, p=8.69x10-5; Figure 4b). There was no significant difference in manta ray abundance when manta rays were not feeding or were absent.</p>
<p><strong>Try:</strong> Biomass of zooplankton (Figure 4a) was significantly higher during manta ray feeding events than when manta rays were not feeding (9.33 mg m-3, n=12; or were absent (ANOVA F<sub>(2,87)</sub>=11.41, p=3.98x10-5). There was no significant difference in zooplankton biomass when manta rays were not feeding or were absent.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.10.2</span> Lists</h3>
<p>The use of lists highlights a difference between writing in novels and scientific/technical writing. In a novel, there are never boring, repetitive lists that would lose Readers’ interest. In scientific and technical writing, however, lists are often vital for helping the Reader follow a complex argument or know all the different causes. Only use lists when there are three or more items: two items can just be explained one after the other and the Reader can easily follow. Lists are normally introduced with a sentence that states there are few/several/many explanations/reasons/steps for something.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.12.1</span> British or US English</h3>
<p>The Irish playwright Oscar Wilde described America and Britain as “<em>two nations divided by the same language</em>.” Many of the differences between US and British spelling were championed by the American teacher and lexicographer Noah Webster in the early 19th century. He saw the simplification of English spelling as a mark of American independence. Commonwealth nations generally follow British English. Although traditionally British journals have used British English and American journal American English, journals are usually flexible these days with whether you use British or US English. However, the most important advice is to be consistent in your usage. The best ways to do this are to be familiar with different forms, and to choose the English version on your spell checker in your word processor!</p>

Rephrasing sometimes can help.
